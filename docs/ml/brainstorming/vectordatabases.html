    <h1>The Rise of Vector Databases: What Software Engineers Need to Know in 2025</h1>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <p>
            From powering semantic search to serving as memory layers in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, vector databases are becoming as foundational as traditional RDBMSs once were. In 2025, engineers must understand not only what vector databases are, but how to integrate them efficiently into AI-native pipelines.

        <h2>What Are Vector Databases?</h2>
        <p>
            Vector databases are specialized data systems designed for storing and retrieving high-dimensional vectors â€” numerical embeddings generated from models like BERT, CLIP, or OpenAI's text-embedding-ada. Unlike traditional databases which store tabular or document-style data and support exact match or range queries, vector DBs optimize for <strong>approximate nearest neighbor (ANN)</strong> searches over floating-point vectors.

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Why They Matter in AI Systems</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Semantic Search:</strong> Retrieve documents based on meaning, not keywords.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> Compare user/item embeddings in multi-dimensional space.</li>
            <li><strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):</strong> Enhance LLMs with external context retrieved via similarity search.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-modal Applications:</strong> Enable joint querying across text, images, and audio embeddings.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Key Players in 2025</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):</strong> Fast, optimized for local use and research. Lacks a persistent server or replication.</li>
            <li><strong>Pinecone:</strong> Fully managed, highly scalable, supports hybrid search. Higher cost, less customizable internals.</li>
            <li><strong>Weaviate:</strong> Graph and schema-aware with built-in hybrid search and modules. Can be heavier operationally.</li>
            <li><strong>Qdrant:</strong> Open-source, production-ready with gRPC and REST, good balance between features and control.</li>
            <li><strong>Chroma:</strong> Lightweight, developer-friendly, used in LangChain by default. Still maturing in scale and ops.</li>
            <li><strong>Milvus:</strong> High-throughput ANN engine, cloud-native deployment. Complexity increases with scale.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>How the Field Is Evolving</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>LLM Integration:</strong> Vector DBs are now part of the prompt pipeline for tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI.</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid Search:</strong> Combining sparse (TF-IDF/BM25) and dense (embeddings) for higher accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Streaming Ingestion:</strong> Real-time vector pipelines with Kafka, Redpanda, or Arrow-based formats.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory & Compute Optimization:</strong> Quantization, HNSW pruning, and tiered storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Considerations:</strong> Tradeoffs between self-hosted FAISS and managed solutions like Pinecone or Weaviate Cloud.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Common Pitfalls & Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Don't store raw text:</strong> Store metadata + embedding separately to allow flexible re-embedding.</li>
            <li><strong>Ensure index persistence:</strong> Especially in FAISS or Milvus, persistence needs explicit handling.</li>
            <li><strong>Retrain-aware indexing:</strong> If your embedding model evolves, so should your vector store.</li>
            <li><strong>Latency tuning:</strong> Balance index type (e.g., HNSW vs IVFFlat) with search accuracy and speed.</li>
            <li><strong>Version your indexes:</strong> Tag with model version and metadata to ensure reproducibility.</li>
        </ul>

from qdrant_client.http.models import PointStruct

# Load model
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Create embedding

embedding = model.encode(text).tolist()

# Initialize Qdrant
client = QdrantClient(host="localhost", port=6333)

# Upsert vector
client.upsert(collection_name="docs", points=[
    PointStruct(id=1, vector=embedding, payload={"text": text})
])

# Query
results = client.search(collection_name="docs", query_vector=embedding, top=3)
for r in results:
