    <h1>Setting up AWS API Gateway with Stages</h1>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Setting up an API Gateway in AWS can feel daunting, especially when it comes to managing different versions
            and environments efficiently. In this guide, I will walk through how to set up API Gateway in AWS and
            leverage stages for versioning and handling multiple environments like development, staging, and production.
            Although it might seem straightforward, I struggled to find a comprehensive document that fully addressed my
            requirements, so I'm documenting my experience here.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The problem I was trying to solve is that I am working on a serverless web app to teach myself as many AWS
            services as I could. Since I was going to do a lot of testing and experimenting in development, I needed to
            ensure that I have a separate environment so I can easily experiment without breaking things.</p>

        <p>Since I was building a serverless app and wanted to use AWS Lambda, I decided to use API Gateway to connect
            the backend to the frontend. As an API designer, you want to ensure routes are well defined and secure to
            maintain data integrity for integrated systems.</p>

        <p>After a lot of research, here is what I learned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can have one AWS Lambda function that handles the whole web app for you. Lambda is just a
                function handle, so that handle can be defined anywhere as long as you set the Handler property of
                Runtime Settings of your Lambda Function. By default, when you create a Lambda Function, the class that
                contains the handler has the same name as your function. For more details, check out <a

                using Flask, then your handler will be in the app.py file because that is where you define your routes.
                You would also need a way of parsing URI and handling routes in there.</li>
            <li>If all the routes of my web app are handled by only one Lambda function, scaling becomes complex. To
                address this, I decided to have Lambda functions logically grouped, for instance, one for authentication
                purposes, one for handling flashcards, some for integration, and so on.</li>
            <li>To manage different versions of my functions, I used Aliases for AWS Lambda. An alias represents a
                snapshot of the function and its configuration, including environment-specific variables, allowing me to
                control versions between development and production environments effectively.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>API Gateway</h2>
        <p>This is the place where you integrate routes with your backend Lambda functions. Below are the AWS CLI
            commands to create a Lambda function with two aliases:</p>

        <pre><code># Create the Lambda function
aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name MyFunction \
  --runtime python3.8 \
  --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/MyLambdaRole \
  --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler \
  --zip-file fileb://function.zip

# Publish a version of the function
aws lambda publish-version --function-name MyFunction

# Create the "prod" alias pointing to version 1
aws lambda create-alias \
  --function-name MyFunction \
  --name prod \
  --function-version 1

# Create the "dev" alias pointing to the latest version
aws lambda create-alias \
  --function-name MyFunction \
  --name dev \
  --function-version 1</code></pre>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Step 1: Create Your API in API Gateway</h2>
        <p>To begin, log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the API Gateway service. Somewhere on the
            page, probably at the top right, you will see 'Create API'. Choose "Create API" and select the appropriate
            type, either HTTP or REST, depending on your use case. Give your API a name and a description that clearly
            reflects its purpose. This will help you and your team keep things organized as your API evolves.</p>

            style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:15px;">
        <p>For this blog post, I created an HTTP API, and in a later post, where we need to deliver the integration
            feature in our web app, we will define REST APIs. I named the API 'demo'. Below are the screenshots of each
            step. I integrated with the Lambda function MyTestFunction for two aliases I defined in the Lambda: dev and
            prod. You would need to type the ending manually as you would only see the ARN of the function, not the
            alias.</p>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Step 2: Define Resources and Methods</h2>
        <p>After creating your API, it's time to define the resources and methods that make up the endpoints of your
            application. This step is crucial because it lays the foundation for how your API will interact with
            clients. You can think of resources as the nouns and methods as the verbs that describe actions to be
            performed. For instance, <code>/users</code> could be a resource, and actions like GET or POST are methods
            that interact with that resource.</p>

        <p>Resources are essentially paths or endpoints of your API, like <code>/users</code> or <code>/orders</code>.
            For each resource, add methods such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE, which correspond to the operations you
            want to perform. The console provides an intuitive interface to add and configure these methods.</p>
        <p>For instance, in my FlashCard app, I have a resource which is the <code>/FlashCards</code> deck, and I need
            to define a method to GET the decks of FlashCards. I will also have a <code>/user</code> resource for user
            registration, allowing users to create a customizable account. Therefore, I need to provide a method for
            registration via HTTP, which is a POST method.</p>

            style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:15px;">
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Step 3: Set Up Stages for Versioning</h2>
        <p>AWS API Gateway uses "stages" to help you manage multiple environments or versions of your API. Stages are
            essentially snapshots of your API at a given point in time. To create a stage, go to the "Stages" section
            under your API, click "Create Stage," and give it a meaningful name like <code>dev</code>,
            <code>staging</code>, or <code>prod</code>.
        </p>
        <p>By default, all HTTP APIs created through the console have a stage named $default. Since I didn't need it, I
            deleted it.</p>
        <p>Each stage can have its own configuration, such as logging, caching, and throttling settings, which allows
            for fine-tuning based on the environment. For example, in a <code>dev</code> stage, you might want to enable
            detailed logging to help with debugging, while in <code>prod</code>, you could have caching enabled for
            better performance.</p>

            style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:15px;">
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Step 4: Deploy Your API to a Stage</h2>
        <p>Once you've configured your API, you need to deploy it to a specific stage. Deployment in API Gateway is the
            process of taking the current state of your API and making it accessible under a specific URL associated
            with the stage. Click "Deploy API," select the stage (e.g., <code>staging</code>), and provide a deployment
            description to keep track of what changes are being deployed.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Step 5: Handle Multiple Versions of Your API</h2>
        <p>As your API evolves, you may need to make breaking changes. Instead of modifying the existing version, you
            can create a new version of your API by copying it and then deploying it to a new stage, like
            <code>v2</code>. This approach ensures that existing consumers of your API are not affected by the changes,
            while allowing new consumers to use the updated version.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Step 6: Utilize Stage Variables</h2>
        <p>AWS API Gateway allows you to use stage variables, which are key-value pairs associated with a stage. These
            can be used to manage environment-specific settings, like connecting to different databases or services in
            each stage. For instance, a <code>dev</code> stage variable might point to a test database, while
            <code>prod</code> points to a live database.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Step 7: Test Your Setup</h2>
        <p>After deploying your API to different stages, make sure to test each stage thoroughly. AWS provides built-in
            testing tools within the API Gateway console, but you can also use tools like Postman or cURL to validate
            that your endpoints are working as expected for each environment.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Best Practices for Staging</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep Environment-Specific Configurations Separate:</strong> Use stage variables and IAM roles to
                ensure that configurations are isolated between environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Automate Deployments:</strong> Use CI/CD tools like AWS CodePipeline to automate deployments to
                different stages, minimizing manual intervention and errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor Each Stage Separately:</strong> Enable CloudWatch metrics for each stage to get detailed
                insights into usage patterns, errors, and performance, allowing you to catch issues before they impact
                end users.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Setting up API Gateway stages in AWS allows you to efficiently manage multiple versions and environments for
            your API, ensuring smooth development and deployment workflows. By using stages, deployment becomes more
            structured, and you can easily roll out updates without disrupting existing services.</p>

        <p>In the next post, we’ll dive deeper into setting up CI/CD for API Gateway using AWS CodePipeline to further
            streamline the deployment process.</p>
