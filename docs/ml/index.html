    <h1>Understanding Neural Networks in NLP and Implementing One in PyTorch</h1>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Natural Language Processing (NLP) has revolutionized the way machines interact with human language, powering
            applications like virtual assistants, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. At the heart of modern
            NLP
            systems lies <strong>neural networks</strong> â€” powerful algorithms designed to mimic the workings of the
            human
            brain. This post will introduce the basics of neural networks and show you how to implement one using
            PyTorch.

        <h2>What Are Neural Networks?</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>neural network</strong> is a machine learning model that processes information in a way similar to
            the
            human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected "neurons" that transform input data into meaningful
            outputs.
            These networks form the backbone of <strong>deep learning</strong> models and have proven incredibly
            effective in NLP tasks,
            from text classification to translation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In NLP, neural networks analyze text data, learning the relationships between words, phrases, and sentences.
            By
            the end of training, they can predict outcomes like the sentiment of a sentence, whether a text belongs to a
            certain
            category, or how a sentence might be translated into another language.

        <h2>Key Components of a Neural Network</h2>
        <p>Understanding how a neural network works requires breaking down its components:</p>

        <h3>1. Layers</h3>
        <ul class="list-group mb-4">
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Input Layer</strong>: Where the data enters the network. For NLP, this
                data could be word embeddings or other representations of text.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Hidden Layers</strong>: Intermediate layers that apply transformations
                to the input data. Multiple hidden layers allow the network to learn increasingly complex patterns.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Output Layer</strong>: The final layer produces the network's
                prediction, such as a classification label or a translated sentence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Activation Functions</h3>
        <p>Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns. Common
            activation functions include:</p>
        <ul class="list-group mb-4">
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)</strong>: Outputs the input if it's
                positive; otherwise, it outputs zero.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Sigmoid</strong>: Squeezes input values between 0 and 1, making it
                suitable for binary classification.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Softmax</strong>: Converts output values into probabilities for
                multi-class classification.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Forward and Backward Propagation</h3>
        <ul class="list-group mb-5">
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Forward Propagation</strong>: The process where the input data passes
                through the network's layers to produce an output.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Backward Propagation</strong>: After forward propagation, the network
                compares its prediction with the actual result, calculates the error, and adjusts its weights
                accordingly using a process called <strong>gradient descent</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sample Code in PyTorch</h2>
        <pre><code>
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the network
class NeuralNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(NeuralNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.fc1(x)
        out = self.relu(out)
        out = self.fc2(out)
        return out

# Initialize the network
net = NeuralNet(input_size=784, hidden_size=128, output_size=10)
print(net)
        </code></pre>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Neural networks form the foundation of deep learning models in NLP, allowing machines to understand and
            process
            language in ways that were previously unimaginable. With PyTorch, you can implement neural networks that
            tackle
            real-world NLP tasks, from sentiment analysis to machine translation. By following the steps outlined above,
            you're
            now ready to build and train your own neural networks in PyTorch!
