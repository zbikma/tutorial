      <p><em>Stand out in a market that doesn’t want to hire juniors — by proving you’re already halfway to mid-level.</em></p>
    </header>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        It’s 2025. Most companies are freezing junior hiring. Startups want “immediate contributors,” and enterprise job posts ask for 3+ years of experience for “entry-level” roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        So how do you break into tech as a junior dev today? The answer: show that you're <strong>driven, self-sufficient, and already delivering value</strong>. You don’t need a job to prove that—you need the right projects.
      </p>
      <p>Here are 10 battle-tested project ideas that demonstrate initiative, depth, and readiness to be hired—even when no one's hiring juniors.</p>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">1. Bug Tracker (with User Auth & Notifications)</h2>
      <p>
        Build a mini Jira or GitHub Issues clone. Include user authentication, role-based access (admin/dev/client), ticket assignment, and email or Slack-like notifications.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Shows you're thinking in terms of teams, systems, and real-world workflows.</p>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">2. Personal DevOps CI/CD Pipeline</h2>
      <p>
        Create a GitHub Action or GitLab CI pipeline that lints, tests, builds, and deploys your apps. Bonus: Deploy to a cloud VM, Vercel, or Netlify.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Demonstrates modern DevOps knowledge and shows you don’t wait for others to deploy your work.</p>
    </section>

      <h2 class="mb-3">3. SaaS Billing Simulator</h2>
      <p>

      <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> LLM-based apps are everywhere. Knowing how to build one sets you apart instantly.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">5. Clone & Improve an Open Source Project</h2>
      <p>
        Pick a popular GitHub repo with active issues. Fork it, fix a bug or add a feature, and explain your reasoning in a blog or README.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Shows you can read others' code, navigate large repos, and <em>contribute like a real teammate</em>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">6. Self-Hosted Portfolio with Blog and Admin Panel</h2>
      <p>
        Build your portfolio from scratch—no templates. Include a blog with Markdown support and an admin dashboard for editing content.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Shows you care about your personal brand and can build real CMS-like systems.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-3">7. Developer Tool / CLI Utility</h2>

      <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Demonstrates empathy for other devs and problem-solving ability.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">8. Data Pipeline with Public Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        Ingest data from a public source (like COVID stats, GitHub events, or weather), process it, and visualize trends on a dashboard.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Shows you're not just a coder—you can work with data and think in pipelines.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">9. Job Tracker with Resume Tailoring</h2>
      <p>
        Build a job application tracker that scrapes job descriptions and suggests custom keywords or resume edits. Use NLP libraries like spaCy or HuggingFace.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Solves your own job hunt pain and shows you're willing to learn advanced tools.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">10. Real-Time Chat App with Presence</h2>
      <p>
        Build a chat app using WebSockets or Firebase with presence indicators, typing status, and read receipts.

      <h2 class="mb-3">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The job market may be tough, but great projects are still the strongest signal of readiness. Pick 2–3 of these, push them to GitHub, and write a post about your decisions and trade-offs. You're not just learning to code—you're showing how you <strong>build</strong> without permission.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Choose real-world problems to solve</li>
        <li>✅ Go beyond tutorials—design, ship, and explain</li>
        <li>✅ Be your own product manager and QA</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And most importantly—<strong>don’t wait to be hired to start acting like a professional.</strong></p>
